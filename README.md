# Expense App
This repository was created for me to gain knowledge about writing a backend. The application allows you to enter information about expenses and income. It also calculates the final balance of the user's account.
You can enter a new expense/income, change an existing one, delete one, or view the entire list of entered transactions.
In creating this repository, I used Postman.
